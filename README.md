# Web Development Environment using Homebrew

There's something to be said for developing on virtual machines that are a one-to-one replica of production environments. I will never deny that.

But... there's also something to be said about using Homebrew for my development needs and it giving me the least amount of problems. Docker's endless configuration, Canonical's multipass mac firewall issue, UTM's gui cruft that I don't need, etc.
